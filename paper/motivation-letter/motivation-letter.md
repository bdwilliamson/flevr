Dear Professor Urbanek,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "flevr: Flexible, Ensemble-based Variable Selection in R" for publication in the R Journal.

Variable selection in missing-data contexts is complicated by two issues: (i) a desire for the results to be robust to departures from simplifying modelling assumptions, and (ii) the need to incorporate a missing-data approach. Often, researchers turn to machine learning to increase robustness, but the options for missing-data variable selection when machine learning tools have been used are not easily interpretable. The `flevr` `R` package provides an open-source tool for performing variable selection in missing-data contexts using flexible, ensemble machine learning algorithms.

We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful for their work because it provides generally useful examples of how to use functions in the package, that will be useful in many applications.
