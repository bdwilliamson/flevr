# v0.0.0.9000

## Major changes

The first version of the `flevr` package! This package provides functions for variable selection using flexible ensembles. These functions can be used on both complete-case and multiply-imputed data. The two procedures considered are based on extrinsic variable importance (estimated using the Super Learner) and intrinsic variable importance (estimated using the Shapley Population Variable Importance Measure). Both can also be embedded within stability selection using `stabs`.
