Description: Perform variable selection in settings with possibly missing data 
    based on extrinsic (algorithm-specific) and intrinsic (population-level) 
    variable importance. Uses a Super Learner ensemble to estimate the 
    underlying prediction functions that give rise to estimates of variable importance.
