Description: Perform variable selection in settings with possibly missing data
    based on extrinsic (algorithm-specific) and intrinsic (population-level)
    variable importance. Uses a Super Learner ensemble to estimate the
    underlying prediction functions that give rise to estimates of variable importance. For more information about the methods, please see Williamson and Huang (arXiv, 2022+) <arXiv:2202.12989>.
